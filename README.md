# RetroPod
A C++ / OpenGL 3D Hovercraft Simulator type Game with retro graphics and some mind-melting maths behind the scenes. It's actually really playable to say i wrote it fresh out of uni back in 2002.\
I seem to remember having dial-up internet at the time and using notepad.exe on windows as my text editor to write all the code!

# Installation Instructions (Windows)
Just download the contents of the dist_win directory (all 8 files) and double click RetroPod.exe to play the game\
If you get stuck see instructions.txt file in the dist_win directory.

# Installation for Mac
Just download the contents of the dist_mac directory (all 7 files). Don't double click RetroPod executable, instead 'cd' to it in the terminal then run from terminal: ./RetroPod\
If you get stuck see instructions.txt file in the dist_win directory.

# To play the game
Once in the main game, here are the keys:\
\
Arrow keys to move around:\
**Up** - both fans forward.\
**Left** / **Right** - one fan forward, one fan reverse to turn\
**Back** - both fans back\
\
**f** = full screen\
**w** = windowed (not full screen)\
**p** = pause/unpause\
**esc** = quit\
NOTE: On Windows please press 'esc' and not close icon on the window to quit - it sometimes doesn't shut the process down properly - i'm fairly sure this is a problem with the glut32.dll file.

# If you want to compile the source:
** You do not need to do this to run the game, only if you want to develop on it **
Ive included the source files and a shell script for compiling on mac. Just open terminal, cd to it and run it.
To compile on windows you have to set up a few things first (that's windows!) so open the compilation_windows directory, open the readme and follow the instructions ive included eveything you need it's not as hard as yu might think!
