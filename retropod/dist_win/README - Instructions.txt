Windows Instructions:

Double click on 'RetroPod.exe' to play the game.


NOTE: Make sure that glut32.dll and all the 5 strangely named txt files are in the same directory as the exe. These files define the levels.

Select option 5 (17 years ago when I wrote this game option 5 was really sluggish, nowadays computers are a bit faster so you're good to just choose option 5)


Once in the main game, here are the keys:

Arrow keys to move around:
UP - both fans forward.
Left / Right - one fan forward, one fan back.
Back - both fans back


f = full screen.
w = not full screen
p = pause/unpause
esc = quit

NOTE: Always use the esc key to quit. Don't use the close icon on the window - it sometimes doesn't shut the process down properly - i'm fairly sure this is a problem with the glut32.dll file on windows and not something i have any control over :(
